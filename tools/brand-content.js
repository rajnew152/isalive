   "What is Better Pitch?",
   "Better Pitch is a real-time voice AI platform that speaks 30+ languages and dialects, including Hindi, Hinglish, Tamil and Telugu, with sub-300ms latency. It runs outbound campaigns, inbound routing, IVR flows, bookings and post-call analytics out of the box."],
  ["What kind of tasks can your AI agents handle?",
   "From customer support and lead qualification to scheduling, data extraction and multi-step workflows. LIA&#x27;s Agents adapt to virtually any repeatable business process. If it can be described, it can be automated.",
   "Can Better Pitch switch languages mid-call?",
   "Yes. Better Pitch detects the language the caller responds in and adapts mid-call. It is especially strong at Hindi, Hinglish and English switching, which happens naturally in almost every Indian business call."],
  ["How secure is my data with LIA?",
   "Security is foundational. All data is encrypted in transit and at rest, access is role-scoped and we operate on SOC 2-compliant infrastructure. Your data is never used to train shared models.",
   "How secure is my data with Better Pitch?",
   "Every call is encrypted in transit and at rest, with role-based workspace permissions, audit-ready records and India data-residency options. We are SOC 2, GDPR and HIPAA ready, with CERT-In empanelled VAPT."],
  ["Can LIA customize solutions for my company?",
   "Yes. Every deployment is tailored: custom workflows, branded voice personas, industry-specific knowledge bases and deep integrations with your existing stack. Enterprise plans include a dedicated solutions architect.",
   "What can an agent do during a call?",
   "Every agent can end calls gracefully, transfer to a fixed or dynamic number, run IVR and press-digit flows, and trigger custom functions that call your APIs mid-call, then continue naturally with the response."],
  ["Can your solutions run on-premises?",
   "Absolutely. We offer fully on-prem and private-cloud deployments for organizations with strict data residency or compliance requirements. Reach out to discuss architecture options.",
   "Do I need a credit card to start?",
   "No. You can sign up and explore the full Better Pitch platform for free without a credit card. Paid plans start at ₹2,999/month, with GST invoices and cancel-anytime billing."],
